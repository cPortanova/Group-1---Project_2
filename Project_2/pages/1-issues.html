        <h1>Issues with the CBord mobile app</h1>
        <p>We found that the CBord mobile app is not well designed, when you search for a door in a certain building on campus the app: 
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Scrolls you down the list to the first matching result.</li>

        <li>This list isn't in alphabetical order, so you might have to scroll up or down more to find other doors in the same building.</li>

        <li>Moves your recent search to the top so that the next time you search for another door in that building, it always takes you to the top.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>This provoked us to investigate the application more. After auditing the application for its usability, accessibility, and functionality, we found that the application had plenty of issues. Some of which we believe can be solved by updating the UI, while some might be back-end server related issues.
